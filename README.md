# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis:
Our manager has given the task of determining the number of retiring employees per their job title, and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We were instructed to use the PH-EmployeeDB to search for our records and where to create our new tables. Once was we were able to determine the employees of those two searches, we summarized our analysis to assist Bobby’s manager prepare for the “silver tsunami”, as many current employees are reaching retirement age.

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
