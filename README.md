# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis:
Our manager has given the task of determining the number of retiring employees per their job title, and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We were instructed to use the PH-EmployeeDB to search for our records and where to create our new tables. Once was we were able to determine the employees of those two searches, we summarized our analysis to assist Bobby’s manager prepare for the “silver tsunami”, as many current employees are reaching retirement age.

## Summary

In Figure 1, we have the newly created retiring_titles table, which contains the records of employees who are retiring. We can see that we have 72,458 employees that are retiring as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. Due to this we would recommend that we ramp up hiring to begin to back fill the roles listed in figure 1. The 'Senior Engineer' role will be most needed following the retiring "tsunami", and with the 'Manager' role being the least affected. Unfortunately given the parameters provided to search the database there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. We can see this as there are no employees in the pool with a 'Senior Engineer' title, one of the most affected by the outgoing wave of employees. We recommend that we branch out the eligibility qualifications so that more current employees can be eligible to join, especially from the available pool of 'Senior Engineer' employees.
